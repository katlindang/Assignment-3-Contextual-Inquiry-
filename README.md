# Assignment-3-Contextual-Inquiry

## Step 1: Design Challenge

##### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
* This project will support users in finding best ways to learn music by exploring other digital options as well as understanding and practicing what works well for them and what doesn't work well in music learning.

##### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
* This activity fulfills the user's need for easier access and cost-effective options for music learning. They will be able to explore other music learning options that are available to them.

##### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
* Some traditional solutions that satisfy music learning needs are personal training sessions, music classes in a classroom setting, and youtube videos. 

##### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

* Music learning used to be inaccessable to many due to various factors. If you factor in the traditional methods, it takes time, money, and transportation to be able to learn music. In addiiton, the cost of instruments, tools, and maintenence has made it difficult for many to keep up with music learning. 


## Step 2:  Target Users

##### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographic: Middle-aged men 
* Preference: Users who are interested in music learning through various tools/instruments
* Expertise: Users of all levels that are interested in music learning 

##### Where would the users do that activity?

* Users can do these activities in their own home. Traditional methods included traveling to a classroom setting, but through technology users are able to learn music through virtual sessions, websites, and apps at a lower cost.


##### What would the users do to complete that activity?

* The goal of this project is to have users learn how to make, use, and learn music. Users will be able to perform music learning activities through user's instruments or tools that are found online or through apps. User's will show how they perform music learning these digital tools.


## Step 3: Research Methods

### Methods
* The methods used for this study are participatory observation and interview. 
  * For participatory observation: I observed 2 actvities: Learning the major scale on [musictheory.net](musictheory.net) and an analysis of Moonlight Sonata on the same site. This user showed how he uses the site to learn music theory.

* The user performed these tasks in their own home on their desktop computer. This user mainly uses free online sources as a way to learn music.

* I used an Iphone audio recording to record the conversation for transcription. 

## Step 4: Observation/Interview Guide

* Please find the link to the interview script [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KryFL1uKlntlG_0kSIA2DTocJg2-fY_7B2TX4fwwDRI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Step 5: Conducting the Research

Below are the audio recording and transcription of the interview and participatory observation.

* Audio recording of the interview can be found here [here] (...)

* Transcription of the interview and participatory observation can be found [here] ( ...)

 

---------------------------------------
Some interesting insights form the interview: 

* User knows how to play the piano, but doesn't know how to read sheet music.
  * "I wanted to use this site to understand music theory and how to play songs through sheet music."

* User has family members that play in a reggae band in the Bay Area
  * "I usually do music learning at home or at parties and family events. I grew up around music and enjoy playing and listening to music in a group setting. My childhood consist of going to family functions and hearing my family perform reggae music. I usually just watch my family play and I just copy what they do."

* User can also play the ukelele
  * "My first instrument I learned how to play is the ukelele. I honestly don't remember when I learned how to play, but I learned how to play it by ear because I saw my family play it.:"
